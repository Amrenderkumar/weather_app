# 🧠 How It Works
The Weather App fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API using either:<br>
* City-based search: User enters a city name, and the app makes an API call to retrieve weather details.
* Geolocation-based weather: Uses the browser's geolocation API to get the user's current coordinates and fetch nearby weather data.
# ⚙️ Environment Variables
This project uses environment variables to securely store API keys. Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following:

<br>
REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# 💡 Future Improvements

🙋‍♂️ FAQ
